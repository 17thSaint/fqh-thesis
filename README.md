# Berry Phase of Fractional Quantum Hall Systems

Here, I present the results of my Master's degree thesis research project.  The project investigated the properties of Fractional Quantum Hall States by using the Berry phase.  This allowed us to find the fractional charge and anyonic statistics of FQH excitations.  Using Composite Fermion theory, we showed the density displacement caused by the interaction of two excitations.  This was already seen in parallel flux attachment, and this project showed a different kind of displacement generated by Reverse Flux Attachment states.  The wavefunction was sampled using a Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo algorithm which was built by me from scratch.
